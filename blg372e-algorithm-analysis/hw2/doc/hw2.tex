\section{PROBLEM 1} 
%
In genereal, order of functions like that:\\

$log(n) \leq n^{x} \leq r^{n} \leq n^{n}$ , $\forall x > 0$ and  $r > 1$ \\

We can order given functions by this order information.\\\\
\begin{math}
F_9 = 2/n < F_{12} = 37 < F_2 = \sqrt{n} < F_1 = n < F_6 = nlog(logn) < F_5 = nlogn < F_8 = nlog(n^2) < F_7 = nlog^2n < F_3 = n^{1.5} < F_4 = n^2 < F_{13} = n^2logn < F_{14} = n^3 < F_{11} = 2^{n/2} < F_{10} = 2^n\\   
\end{math}

\\$F_9$ is a descending function, so its complexity minimum. $F_{12}$ is a constant function and it never grows. Its obvious that relation between $\sqrt{n}$ , $n$ , $nlog(logn)$ and $nlogn$. If we apart function $F_8$ and $F_7$ like $n$ times $log(n^2)$ , $log^2n$; those part of functions act logaritmic and pow of number. $F_3$, $F_4$ , $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ functions are ordered by their power and $log(n) < n$ information. $F_{11}$ and $F_{10}$ functions are ordered by their power.  

\section{PROBLEM 2}
First of all, given algorithm does not work all possible situation. For n = 16 and maximum independent set size = 11, k gets following values:\\\\
8, 12, 6, 9, 13, 7, 10, 15, 8\\\\
There is infinite loop and exceeding loop counter ( $log_2n$ ).\\

Algorithm checks there is an independent set of size k in a graph in the loop. But k is not constant, so for this line complexity is not $O(n^k)$. k can be $O(n)$ . Thus, complexity goes $O(n^n)$ . I assume algorithm terminates $O(log_2n)$ by ignoring bug of algorithm. In this situation, complexty is $O(log_2n*n^n)$ . $(n^2)*2^n < log_2n*n^n$ . Given algorithm is slower than the slides in worst case.

\section{PROBLEM 3}
If we investigate each iteration of outer loop, we can see the second loop after outer loop iterates $n - 1$ . 
If we look inner loop iteration by iteration, total number of iteration is 1 for $S_1$ , 2 for $S_2$ , 3 for $S_3$ ,..., n for $S_n$ . Here, $S_i$ belongs to outer loop. Thus, total number of iteration of whole algorithm is; \\
\\$(n-1)*1 + (n-1)*2 + ... + (n-1)*n$\\
$
(n-1)* \frac{n*(n+1)}{2}
$\\

So complexity is;\\

$ 
(n-1)* \frac{n*(n+1)}{2} = O(n^3)
$\\
\section{PROBLEM 4}
\begin{outerlist}
\item a) It is true.\\
$c_1*h \leq f \leq c_2*h$ $n \geq n_0
\\ d_1*h \leq g \leq d_2*h$ $n \geq n_1
\\ c_1*d_1*h*h \leq f*g \leq c_2*d_2*h*h$ , $n \geq max(n_0, n_1)$
\\ $f*g = \theta(h*h)$
\\ $c_1*d_1$ and $c_2*d_2$ are constant.

\item b)\\
$log_2(n) \leq c*n^{0.5}$ , $n \geq n_0$\\
$n \leq 2^{c*n^{0.5}}$ , $n \geq n_0$\\
$c = 1$ , $n_0 = 0 \Rightarrow n \leq 2^{c*n^{0.5}}$ , $\forall n$ $n \geq n_0$
