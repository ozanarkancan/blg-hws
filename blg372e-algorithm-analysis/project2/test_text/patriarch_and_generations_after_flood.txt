5:1  This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2  Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 5:3  And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5  And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 5:6  And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7  And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:8  And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 5:9  And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10  And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11  And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 5:12  And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13  And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:14  And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 5:15  And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16  And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17  And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 5:18  And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 5:19  And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:20  And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. 5:21  And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22  And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23  And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24  And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. 5:25  And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 5:26  And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27  And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 5:28  And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 5:29  And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 5:30  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31  And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 5:32  And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. ... ... 10:1  Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 10:2  The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 10:3  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 10:4  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 10:5  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 10:6  And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 10:7  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 10:8  And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 10:9  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 10:10  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 10:11  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 10:13  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 10:14  And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 10:15  And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16  And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17  And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 10:19  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 10:20  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 10:21  Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. 10:22  The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 10:23  And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 10:24  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 10:25  And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 10:26  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 10:27  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 10:30  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 10:31  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 10:32  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
